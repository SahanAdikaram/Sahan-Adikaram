## let’s get some knowledge about “*What is this?*”

The term "remote patient monitoring" (RPM, also known as "remote patient management") refers to a technique used in the healthcare delivery system that uses the most recent developments in information technology to gather patient data and deliver useful care instead of conventional healthcare settings. By using the internet of things to stay in constant contact with the patient and the healthcare team while coordinating the treatment remotely, RPM is a technique that can replace the traditional methods employed in healthcare.
This paper makes a new suggestion on how to develop a hospital setting that may be used for ongoing care following hospital release. It includes a smartphone application that gathers health measurements automatically and analyzes the information to suggest remedies or send out alarms. In any emergency, a patient can immediately establish a video call connection with a healthcare professional to acquire further information.

## Healthcare IoT system architecture

Perception, network, and application layers are the three main components of the fundamental IoT-based healthcare architecture, which can be discussed in relation to the healthcare sector.

## Perception, network, and application layers?

### 1)	Perception layer (Sensing systems that collect data) 

The main components of IoT are technologies for perception and identification. Radio frequency identification (RFID), webcams, infrared sensors, GPS, medical sensors, and smart device sensors are a few examples of sensors—devices that can detect changes in the environment. Through object, position, and location recognition, these sensors enable comprehensive perception. They can also convert this data into digital signals for easier and more practical network transfer. Sensor technologies provide real-time treatment monitoring and the collection of several physiological characteristics about a patient, permitting precise diagnosis and effective therapy. Only a small number of IoT sensor devices, many of which have the potential to save lives, are currently being deployed in healthcare settings since they have not been clinically tested or found to be reliable.

### 2)	Network layer (Data communication and storage)

IoT technologies have a network level that consists of wired or wireless networks that communicate, and store processed (layer 1) data locally or centrally. Low, medium, and high frequencies can be used for short-range communication, which includes Bluetooth, Zigbee, low-power Wi-Fi, RFID, wireless sensor networks, and the worldwide system for mobile communications. High frequency fourth generation (4G) cellular networks have become even more effective, and emerging 5G networks are becoming more widely accessible. It is anticipated that these networks will be a significant step forward in the development of IoT applications for the healthcare industry, with the ability to offer dependable connection to many devices at once.

### 3)	Application layer

The application layer defies and applies data, and it is in charge of providing the user with services relevant to that application. For example, some of the most exciting medical applications that the Internet of Things offers involve artificial intelligence (AI). AI has a variety of scientific applications, such as image analysis, text recognition with natural language processing, pharmacological activity design, and gene mutation expression prediction, among others. As an illustration, IoT-based healthcare and the application of deep machine learning can help medical practitioners perceive the invisible and offer new and improved diagnostic capability.

**Although 100% diagnostic accuracy may never be achieved, system performance is consistently improved by integrating technology and physician expertise.
