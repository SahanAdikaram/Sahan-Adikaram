## let‚Äôs get some knowledge about ‚Äú*What is this‚ùì*‚Äù 

The term "remote patient monitoring" (RPM, also known as "remote patient management") refers to a technique used in the healthcare delivery system that uses the most recent developments in information technology to gather patient data and deliver useful care instead of conventional healthcare settings. By using the internet of things to stay in constant contact with the patient and the healthcare team while coordinating the treatment remotely, RPM is a technique that can replace the traditional methods employed in healthcare.
This paper makes a new suggestion on how to develop a hospital setting that may be used for ongoing care following hospital release. It includes a smartphone application that gathers health measurements automatically and analyzes the information to suggest remedies or send out alarms. In any emergency, a patient can immediately establish a video call connection with a healthcare professional to acquire further information. 

## üî∑ Healthcare IoT system architecture

Perception, network, and application layers are the three main components of the fundamental IoT-based healthcare architecture, which can be discussed in relation to the healthcare sector.

## Perception, network, and application layers‚ùî

### 1)	Perception layer (Sensing systems that collect data) 

The main components of IoT are technologies for perception and identification. Radio frequency identification (RFID), webcams, infrared sensors, GPS, medical sensors, and smart device sensors are a few examples of sensors‚Äîdevices that can detect changes in the environment. Through object, position, and location recognition, these sensors enable comprehensive perception. They can also convert this data into digital signals for easier and more practical network transfer. Sensor technologies provide real-time treatment monitoring and the collection of several physiological characteristics about a patient, permitting precise diagnosis and effective therapy. Only a small number of IoT sensor devices, many of which have the potential to save lives, are currently being deployed in healthcare settings since they have not been clinically tested or found to be reliable.

### 2)	Network layer (Data communication and storage)

IoT technologies have a network level that consists of wired or wireless networks that communicate, and store processed (layer 1) data locally or centrally. Low, medium, and high frequencies can be used for short-range communication, which includes Bluetooth, Zigbee, low-power Wi-Fi, RFID, wireless sensor networks, and the worldwide system for mobile communications. High frequency fourth generation (4G) cellular networks have become even more effective, and emerging 5G networks are becoming more widely accessible. It is anticipated that these networks will be a significant step forward in the development of IoT applications for the healthcare industry, with the ability to offer dependable connection to many devices at once.

### 3)	Application layer

The application layer defies and applies data, and it is in charge of providing the user with services relevant to that application. For example, some of the most exciting medical applications that the Internet of Things offers involve artificial intelligence (AI). AI has a variety of scientific applications, such as image analysis, text recognition with natural language processing, pharmacological activity design, and gene mutation expression prediction, among others. As an illustration, IoT-based healthcare and the application of deep machine learning can help medical practitioners perceive the invisible and offer new and improved diagnostic capability.

**Although 100% diagnostic accuracy may never be achieved, system performance is consistently improved by integrating technology and physician expertise.**

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a great example of a developing technology that has an impact on communication and internet systems. It is intended to be used without the assistance of a human being and works with connected devices that can gather and redirect data through wireless networks. This is sometimes referred to as IoMT, or the Internet of Medical Things, in the context of medicine. Additionally, this is a practical idea that makes it simple for us to communicate with one another both physically and online at work. The communication network, end-terminal at the hospital, data gathering system, and data processing system are the fundamental components of a remote monitoring system (Malasinghe, Ramzan and Dahal, 2019).

With the help of ideally any network and service, IoT enables connections between people and things Anywhere, Anytime, with Anything and Anyone. With the use of the internet and strong data analysis tools, IoT is utilized in consumer goods, automobiles and trucks, industrial and utility components, and other items used in daily life to make living much easier today.

## üî∑ After all this let‚Äôs discuss advantages of IoT system in healthcare

IoT is a wireless computer network that connects with the support of apps and hardware. The patient no longer needs to physically visit the doctor in order to receive a diagnosis, be monitored, or have their medical information tracked thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. IoT systems can also be utilized in medical settings to monitor patients. The main idea of remote patient monitoring in IoT systems is to keep track of the patient outside of the hospital and make quicker choices in real-time on patients' ailments. Emergency medical care and real-time sickness identification can boost a patient's chances of recovery.

One benefit of IoT is that it can save money and time. Treatments and monitoring at a distance can save a lot of money and time. Heart attacks, strokes, and arrhythmias are all very common and sometimes fatal situations related to cardiovascular illnesses. Monitoring a patient's vital signs, including heart rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation levels, and respiration rate, provides a broad and baseline understanding of such life-threatening illnesses and makes them simple to identify. Modern gadgets with sensors that can collect these data, like smart watches and smart phones, can be used to collect them. Some of these smart watches, such as apple watches, may recognize a patient's vital signs that are declining and call the appropriate authorities in an emergency. There are instances of such life-saving events that happened across the world. 

Smart devices can be used to identify individuals with low levels of exercise tolerance, such as those who have had heart surgery or Parkinson's disease, who pose a risk of injury. This can speed up the decision-making process for healthcare professionals. Diabetes is a relatively common disease marked by excessive blood glucose levels in the patient's blood that should only be managed by careful monitoring of blood glucose levels and adherence to prescribed guidelines. The health care practitioner can change medication, doses, a patient's eating habits, and exercise levels with the help of regular monitoring.

Hospitals can monitor patients in a variety of ways. Employees can store equipment like (PCA) medicine pumps, EKG machines, oxygen tanks, and IV pumps in their unit for later use. IoT could be used in hospitals to track limited shared equipment and patient-controlled analgesia. According to ten internet of things (IoT) healthcare examples, "Mood-aware" IoT devices are also used to monitor depression and mood. Devices can infer details about a patient's mental state by gathering and analyzing data like heart rate and blood pressure. Even the patient's eye movements can be tracked by sophisticated IoT devices for mood monitoring.

Reminding patients to take their prescribed medications as directed and to have regular checkups will help them maintain a healthy lifestyle and lower their chance of developing issues down the road and the need for hospitalization. In Sri Lanka, multi-media conferencing is frequently utilized to provide patients with health information and to educate families about their own health. This is a far more straightforward method of collecting data in an IoT system, which is advantageous in terms of saving time and money.

## üî∑ Remember through all this advantages also we must talk little about disadvantages of IoT system in healthcare. However, reality is pros of this overweight cons.

Health-related data collection is particularly vulnerable to cybercriminals since the data can be hacked and exploited to obtain personal health information about patients and providers. Health-related items are quite valuable, such as buying drugs and medical supplies with phony IDs so they can resell them later.

Even high-quality video conferencing may not always be sufficient because it restricts the amount of physical inspection needed, which is a drawback. IoMT devices have various legal and regulatory problems since these devices collect highly sensitive data from people. Data accuracy can occasionally be questioned because data can be modified due to machine error or deliberate alterations by a human. As a result, depending on the location, using these gadgets can occasionally be challenging.


## üîò CONCLUSION

Everyone is connected to smart devices and the internet, and the present and future are constrained by an age of science and technology. IoT and patient monitoring systems, which will be used more practically in the future as IoMT is a multi-billion-dollar industry, will benefit the health sector in the long term. Because diseases and illnesses will be easier to spot, more individuals will live longer overall.

In addition to patient monitoring, IoT solutions are a new technology that may be extensively employed in many areas of healthcare, such as accurate medical record-keeping, device integration, sampling, and illness causes. IoT sensor-based devices have a great ability to lower the danger of surgery in difficult instances and are beneficial for pandemics of the COVID-19 kind. With the use of this technology, clinicians may quickly identify changes to the COVID-19 patient's vital statistics. As it advances toward the ideal approach for an information system to adapt world-class results and makes it possible for the hospital's treatment systems to be improved, this information-based service creates new healthcare opportunities.

In order to advance the IoMT industry, a significant difficulty that this sector is currently facing is data privacy and security. As patient information is regarded as extremely sensitive data and is viewed as confidential in the context of healthcare, it is vital for this industry to provide data protection and privacy. Special security measures must be put in place to reduce the risk of data security breaches, and this can be seen as opening new opportunities for this sector of the economy. As mentioned in this study, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a highly advanced, developing technology with a wide range of applications in the provision of precise medical care. These applications include managing inventories used in the medical industry and the medical supply chain to ensure that the right item is delivered at the right time and location. Intelligent IoT devices would function independently. To make disease identification and follow-up more effective, both private and public clouds that store data as well as software will be available.

IoT systems can also be automated, and by combining machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), data analysis can be done more quickly and effectively.
